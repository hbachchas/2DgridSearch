This is a Qt GUI project.
As it's a GUI project so you may want to use Qt-Creator for opening the project.
If you don't want this to be a GUI project, you will have to convert it to console by replacing all the GUI widgets with manual (command line or hard-coded) entries.

Desc:
some of the graph search algorithms have been implemented [mainwindow.cpp --> visualSearch()]
different block configurations can be created [blockcreator.cpp]
